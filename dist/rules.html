    Liar's Dice is a bluffing game. Each player begins the game with 5 six-sided dice; the goal is to be the last player remaining with dice.
    <br/><br/>
    Each round proceeds as follows:
        
        <li>Each player rolls all their dice. They remain hidden from other players.</li>
        <li>The first player makes a bid, by choosing a dice face(2-6), and an amount of that dice face that they believe were rolled among all players' dice. Ones are wild; they count as all dice faces.</li>
        <li>Subsequent players may either challenge the bid, or raise the bid, by increasing the dice face, the amount, or both, decreasing neither. Continue until a player challenges.</li>
        <li>Once a player challenges a bid, all dice are revealed. If the predicted amount(or more) of the chosen dice face is revealed, the player who challenged loses one die. If not, the bidder loses one die.</li>
        <li>The player who lost a die bids first in the next round. Players without dice are eliminated.</li>
